Some of the best PMs I know make their decisions based on first principles. A first principle is a _"basic, foundational proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption."._

我所知道的一些最优秀的产品经理都是基于第一性原理来做决策的。第一性原理是"一种基本的、根本的命题或假设，不能从任何其他命题或假设中推导出来"。

An example of one that we use for our developer platform team are that _"all platform features should be like Lego blocks"_, meaning that developers should be able to use any combination of features when building an app. Features should be interoperable, just like Legos.

我们开发者平台团队使用的一个例子是"所有平台功能都应该像乐高积木一样"，这意味着开发者在构建应用时应该能够使用任意组合的功能。功能应该是可互操作的，就像乐高积木一样。

First principle thinking helps PMs because as companies scale, communicating the rationale behind historical, current, and future decisions can be simplified in a way that their team and stakeholders can rally around. This enables people around the PM to move quickly in the same direction, decouple, and make smart trade offs without their presence.

第一性原理思维之所以对产品经理有帮助，是因为随着公司规模的扩大，传达过去、现在和未来决策背后的理由可以简化为团队和利益相关者可以团结一致的方式。这使得产品经理周围的人能够快速朝同一方向前进，解耦，并在他们不在场的情况下做出明智的权衡。

**What about first principles for the craft of Product Management?**

**那么产品管理这门技艺的第一性原理是什么呢？**

如果第一性原理可以帮助产品经理使他们的团队围绕产品中最重要的事情达成一致，我相信它们也可以帮助产品经理思考产品管理本身这门技艺。

That's what this post is about: w_hat are the foundational propositions and assumptions of product management that cannot be deduced?

这就是这篇文章要讨论的内容：产品管理中那些无法推导出的基本命题和假设是什么？

## Left Side, Right Side

左脑，右脑
  
The first principles of Product Management can be reduced to:

产品管理的第一性原理可以归结为：

**A. Maximize impact to the mission:** develop a product strategy that maximizes the impact to an organization's mission given a set of inputs.

**A. 最大化对使命的影响：** 在给定一组输入的情况下，制定一个能最大化对组织使命影响的产品策略。

**B. Accomplish everything through others:** PMs do not directly build or operate the product, instead they enable those around them to do it better.

**B. 通过他人完成一切：** 产品经理不直接构建或操作产品，而是使他们周围的人能够做得更好。

![Image 3](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3cuMXu3Eo-ALJlAfZ1KsCA.png)

These two principles represent the left and right sides of your brain. The left is defined by logic, research, and rigour. The right is defined by creativity, intuition, and empathy.

这两个原则代表了你大脑的左右两侧。左脑由逻辑、研究和严谨定义。右脑由创造力、直觉和同理心定义。

Great product managers fuse these two principles into all their decisions and everything they do should derive from them.

优秀的产品经理将这两个原则融入他们所有的决策中，他们所做的一切都应该源于这两个原则。

In retrospect, most of my previous posts are simply derivatives of these two principles. [Making Good Decisions as a PM](https://blackboxofpm.com/making-good-decisions-as-a-product-manager-c66ddacc9e2b) is about principle A, [Ruthless Prioritization](https://blackboxofpm.com/ruthless-prioritization-e4256e3520a9) and [Applying Leverage as a PM](https://blackboxofpm.com/applying-leverage-as-a-product-manager-ffad4a99db24) were about principle B. [MVPM](https://blackboxofpm.com/mvpm-minimum-viable-product-manager-e1aeb8dd421) is a bit of both. I wish I had written this first, but frankly I needed to learn it. Let's dig in.

回顾过去，我之前的大多数文章都只是这两个原则的衍生品。《作为产品经理如何做出好决策》是关于原则 A 的，《无情的优先级排序》和《作为产品经理如何运用杠杆》是关于原则 B 的。《最小可行产品经理》则两者兼有。我希望我能先写这篇文章，但老实说我需要先学习这些。让我们深入探讨一下。

## Principle A: Maximize impact to the mission

**原则 A：最大化对使命的影响**

公司所有员工的重点都应该是实现公司的使命，无论这个使命是赚取数十亿美元，创造社会效益，还是两者兼顾。

To this end, the vast majority of people in a company are directly working towards providing a product/service to customers: they are building the product (engineers and designers), taking it to market (marketing and sales), or helping existing customers (support).

为此，公司绝大多数人都在直接为客户提供产品/服务而工作：他们在构建产品（工程师和设计师），将其推向市场（市场营销和销售），或帮助现有客户（支持）。

Product management does nothing to directly build or operate the product for customers. Instead, its core responsibility is to look ahead and inform the builders/operators of the product what the right path is to achieve the goal. _That path is also called the product strategy, and the best ones are those that maximize impact to the mission._

产品管理并不直接为客户构建或操作产品。相反，它的核心责任是展望未来，告知产品的构建者/操作者实现目标的正确路径。这条路径也被称为产品策略，最好的策略是那些能最大化对使命影响的策略。

Defining the product strategy is a massive responsibility… how does a PM do it? By looking at three inputs:

1. What the goal is
2. What the environment around them is signalling
3. What people, money, and time constraints exist


定义产品策略是一项重大责任...产品经理如何做到这一点？通过考虑三个输入：
1. 目标是什么
2. 周围环境发出的信号是什么
3. 存在哪些人员、资金和时间限制

PMs use these inputs to form an opinion on the right path that will lead to fulfillment of the mission.

产品经理利用这些输入来形成对能够实现使命的正确路径的看法。

![Image 4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*iQ2Ob-N_SFMTQFSDLpCgMQ.png)

### 1. What the goal is

1. 目标是什么

Everything starts with the goal. If you don't know where you're supposed to go, you shouldn't even move because you're just as likely to end up further away.

一切都始于目标。如果你不知道你应该去哪里，你甚至不应该移动，因为你很可能最终会离目标更远。

One of the biggest issues I see with PMs is that they don't take the time to really understand the goal. They may be able to recite the mission statement, but do they understand its foundations? I'm talking about the customer assumptions that led to it, the moral/ethical/design boundaries the company intends to stay within to achieve it, and the vision of the world's future that it is supposed to live in.

我看到的产品经理最大的问题之一是，他们没有花时间真正理解目标。他们可能能够背诵使命宣言，但他们理解其基础吗？我指的是导致这个使命的客户假设，公司为实现它而打算保持的道德/伦理/设计界限，以及它应该存在的未来世界愿景。

Great product managers incessantly ask hard questions to leadership to understand the nuances — _the_ _first principles_ — that went into defining the mission they follow. The deeper one can understand it, the more precise their path to the goal will be.

优秀的产品经理不断向领导层提出尖锐的问题，以理解细微差别 — 即定义他们所遵循的使命时所考虑的第一性原理。一个人对此理解得越深，他们通往目标的路径就越精确。

![Image 5](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*cqFJcHZw1G4FDYSzOESdEw.png)

PMs also need to know how other teams are also contributing to the effort. Especially in large companies, aligning across all teams ensures that collisions are avoided and — far better — find opportunities for teams to combine efforts and accelerate progress.

产品经理还需要知道其他团队是如何为这项工作做出贡献的。特别是在大公司中，在所有团队之间保持一致可以确保避免冲突，更好的是，找到团队合作和加速进展的机会。

_Only_ once a PM is sure they know their company's goal, and the goals of other teams around them, are they ready to effectively setup their own team's goals, which must ladder up clearly to the broader mission.

只有当产品经理确信他们了解公司的目标，以及周围其他团队的目标时，他们才能有效地设定自己团队的目标，这些目标必须清晰地与更广泛的使命相呼应。

### 2. What the environment is signalling

2. 环境发出的信号是什么

Most plans start out as a straight line to the goal, but the path never ends up as one. It’s impossible to see all the obstacles ahead, and sometimes the goal is so far away you can’t always tell if you’ve drifted off course. To hedge against this, PMs have to listen to their environment to detect, anticipate and course correct the path.

大多数计划开始时都是通向目标的直线，但路径最终从不是一条直线。不可能看到前方所有的障碍，有时目标如此遥远，你无法始终判断是否偏离了航线。为了防范这一点，产品经理必须倾听他们的环境，以检测、预测和纠正路径。

![Image 6](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*qr2pVVZQ8GBYCxiejjuHPQ.png)

你想要寻找的环境信号主要有两类：

_Customer signals_ are the qualitative and quantitative data sets you accumulate on how customers are using the product. This data is the "ping" from the goal, and when you hear that ping get stronger, you know you aren't veering too far off course.

客户信号是你积累的关于客户如何使用产品的定性和定量数据集。这些数据是来自目标的"回声"，当你听到这个回声变强时，你就知道你没有偏离太远。

_Market signals_ are the "asteroid warnings" that represent shifts in the world that will affect your path. They are the changes in the competitive, political, and socioeconomic landscapes that affect your company and customers.

市场信号是代表世界变化的"小行星警告"，这些变化将影响你的路径。它们是影响你的公司和客户的竞争、政治和社会经济格局的变化。

Constantly listening to the world outside your company walls is a critical input to great product management. And what you hear from customers is the ultimate validation of your achievement of the goal.

不断倾听公司墙外的世界是优秀产品管理的关键输入。而你从客户那里听到的反馈是你实现目标的最终验证。

### 3. What people, money, and time constraints exist

3. 存在哪些人员、资金和时间限制
  
How far a rocket ship can go is constrained by the fuel it holds, the quality of its crew, and its time-constrained ability to leverage [gravitational boosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) using from other celestial bodies like Jupiter. Similarly, product teams are constrained by the _money, people, and time_ they have to launch a product. On any given mission, a product team will be constrained by all three of these.

火箭能飞多远受到它所携带的燃料、船员的素质以及利用其他天体（如木星）进行引力助推的时间限制能力的约束。同样，产品团队受到他们推出产品所拥有的资金、人员和时间的限制。在任何给定的任务中，产品团队都会受到这三个因素的限制。

![Image 7](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*MmK_VI36cNFP6pu_J83Dbg.png)

**_**_People_** on a product team often represent the biggest constraint. Too often, that constraint is only thought of as the number of people working on a product (which it can be), but vastly more important are actual skill and experience levels of the people on the team.

产品团队中的人员通常代表着最大的限制。太多时候，这种限制只被认为是从事产品工作的人数（确实可能是这样），但团队成员的实际技能和经验水平要重要得多。

Just like you wouldn't put the rookie class of NASA on its first mission to Mars, there are product scopes that are beyond the ability of some teams. This isn't their fault, and says nothing of their eventual abilities, but it is something that PMs critically need to understand when figuring out the path forward. To be clear, this applies to the PMs themselves, as well_._ They need the self awareness to know when they're biting off more than they can chew. We'll cover much more on _people_ later in this post.

就像你不会让 NASA 的新手班级执行首次火星任务一样，有些产品范围超出了某些团队的能力。这不是他们的错，也不能说明他们最终的能力如何，但这是产品经理在确定前进道路时需要深刻理解的事情。需要明确的是，这也适用于产品经理自身。他们需要有自我意识，知道什么时候他们在挑战超出自己能力的任务。我们将在本文后面更多地讨论人员问题。

**Money** is a constraint that relates to the ability of a team to hire the right people (salaries), enable them to work (overhead like office space), operate the product (servers and support), and distribute it (marketing).

资金是一种限制，它关系到团队雇佣合适人才（薪资）、使他们能够工作（办公空间等开销）、运营产品（服务器和支持）以及分发产品（营销）的能力。

It would be silly to spend all of your money on salaries to hire the best team, but then not have an office for them to work in, or not have a single dollar to pay for marketing and thus very few customers will find the product.

把所有钱都花在薪资上雇佣最好的团队，却没有办公室让他们工作，或者没有一分钱用于营销以至于很少有客户能找到产品，这是愚蠢的。

Most companies have abstracted away the overhead, operating, and marketing cost complexities from PMs (so that they can focus on product and distribution), but it's important that PMs understand that capital isn't limitless. In lieu of these luxuries, PMs need to consider all the money impacts when building their strategy.

大多数公司已经将开销、运营和营销成本的复杂性从产品经理那里抽象出来（这样他们就可以专注于产品和分发），但重要的是产品经理要理解资金并非无限。在没有这些奢侈条件的情况下，产品经理在制定策略时需要考虑所有的资金影响。

**Time** is the ultimate constraint because unlike the other two, once it's exhausted you cannot get more of it. Time represents reality. It's the reality that products that haven't shipped have yet to produce any value. It's the reality that competitors are taking market share everyday. It's the reality that your company will run out of money next month.

时间是最终的限制，因为与其他两个不同，一旦耗尽就无法获得更多。时间代表现实。这是尚未发布的产品还未产生任何价值的现实。这是竞争对手每天都在抢占市场份额的现实。这是你的公司下个月就会耗尽资金的现实。

PMs must manage time. They must ensure that that they don't miss big windows of opportunity, [make the right tradeoffs](https://blackboxofpm.com/the-time-value-of-shipping-6deaf8d7d565), and [utilize time](https://blackboxofpm.com/deadlines-d6925e5c694f) as a healthy way to foster execution on their team.

产品经理必须管理时间。他们必须确保不错过重大机遇，做出正确的权衡，并将时间作为一种健康的方式来促进团队的执行。

### The right path (product strategy) is at the intersection of the inputs

正确的路径（产品策略）位于输入的交叉点
  
When PMs know the goal, understand the environment, and respect the constraints, they have the necessary inputs to build a great product strategy, which sits somewhere in the intersection of those inputs.

当产品经理了解目标、理解环境并尊重限制时，他们就拥有了构建出色产品策略所需的必要输入，这个策略位于这些输入的交叉点某处。

![Image 8](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*qXTRzG5swh3SS9AgtYyOXw.png)

My reductionist analogy may imply this is easy, but let me be clear that forming a good strategy is very, very difficult. In fact, despite being confident enough to write this post, I am not confident that I can always find the right strategy in practice. It's just fucking complex.

我的简化类比可能暗示这很容易，但让我明确地说，制定一个好的策略是非常非常困难的。事实上，尽管我有足够的信心写这篇文章，但我并不确信我在实践中总能找到正确的策略。这真他妈的复杂。

The other dimension that I hope comes through from this section is that PMs need incredible _breadth_ to effectively synthesize these inputs into strategy. Knowing [enough](https://blackboxofpm.com/mvpm-minimum-viable-product-manager-e1aeb8dd421) about engineering, UX, data, finance, organizational design, operations, research, marketing, etc. makes your ability to synthesize these inputs more effective, and thus your strategy will have a higher likelihood of being successful.

我希望从这一部分传达出来的另一个维度是，产品经理需要令人难以置信的广度来有效地将这些输入综合成策略。对工程、用户体验、数据、财务、组织设计、运营、研究、营销等方面有足够的了解，会使你综合这些输入的能力更有效，因此你的策略更有可能成功。

I feel many PMs get intimidated by this reality and react by specializing in a domain and/or outsourcing the thinking from a domain to another team (e.g. "marketing will figure out how to distribute it"). I really think this type of thinking is counterproductive, and will limit your potential. As scary as it sounds, it _is_ important that you try to learn everything_._ Temper the fear that comes with this with the acknowledgement that, at the same time, it is impossible to know it all.

我感觉许多产品经理被这个现实吓到了，他们的反应是专注于某个领域和/或将某个领域的思考外包给另一个团队（例如"营销团队会想出如何分发它"）。我真的认为这种思维方式是适得其反的，会限制你的潜力。尽管听起来很可怕，但你确实应该尝试学习一切。同时要承认，不可能知道所有的事情，这样可以缓解随之而来的恐惧。

## Principle B: Accomplish everything through others

原则 B：通过他人完成一切
  
In the rocket ship analogy, who did you think the PM was? Were they the person who planted the flag on planet Goal, or were they one of the astronauts on the ship?

在火箭船的类比中，你认为产品经理是谁？他们是在目标星球上插旗的人，还是船上的宇航员之一？

The answer is neither. The PM was actually Mission Control back on Earth. Their job was to support the astronauts who were actually risking their lives for the mission (okay building product isn't _that_ serious, but you get the point). As a PM, you cannot — absolutely cannot — forget that you accomplish everything through others.

答案是两者都不是。产品经理实际上是地球上的任务控制中心。他们的工作是支持那些真正为任务冒生命危险的宇航员（好吧，构建产品并没有那么严重，但你明白我的意思）。作为一个产品经理，你不能 — 绝对不能 — 忘记你是通过他人完成一切的。

**Sorry. You're not even on the spaceship 🚀.**

抱歉。你甚至都不在宇宙飞船上 🚀。

![Image 9](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Ws-euaDAsCDUV_u2SBGXrQ.png)

_Wait, why do so many PM articles promote that PMs should be “jacks of all trades, and do whatever it takes, including coding, marketing, and designing”?_

等等，为什么这么多产品经理文章都在提倡产品经理应该是"多面手，不惜一切代价，包括编码、营销和设计"？

A “doing whatever it takes” mentality doesn’t make you a good product manager, it makes you a good _employee._ When a PM is coding, writing support documents, or designing the product, they’re (presumably) doing so because it’s blocking the critical path to shipping. They’re acting out their values as an employee of the company, not as a PM.

"不惜一切代价"的心态并不能使你成为一个好的产品经理，它只会使你成为一个好员工。当一个产品经理在编码、写支持文档或设计产品时，他们（可能）这样做是因为这些阻碍了发布的关键路径。他们是在履行作为公司员工的价值观，而不是作为产品经理。

Everyone — not just PMs - should aspire to have this mentality. If an engineer happens to also be good at marketing and that's what's blocking the team, they should jump in and help. But that doesn't make them a better _engineer._ The reason PMs often find themselves building-a-bunch-of-stuff is because, as the only member of a team who's not supposed to build, it's rational that they should be the first to volunteer when things fall behind, but that's very different than saying it's part of their job as a PM.

每个人 — 不仅仅是产品经理 — 都应该追求这种心态。如果一个工程师恰好也擅长营销，而这正是阻碍团队的因素，他们应该主动帮忙。但这并不会使他们成为更好的工程师。产品经理经常发现自己在做各种事情的原因是，作为团队中唯一不应该构建的成员，当事情落后时，他们理所当然应该是第一个主动帮忙的人，但这与说这是他们作为产品经理工作的一部分是完全不同的。

Accomplishing everything through others is an irreducible first principle of product management, so to explore it deeper, we're going to completely change the analogy.

通过他人完成一切是产品管理的一个不可简化的第一性原理，为了更深入地探讨它，我们将完全改变类比。

## Product Managers are like coaches of a sports team

产品经理就像体育队的教练

![Image 10](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Dw1ZE1YLUwvhCoOnuNacjQ.png)

There is no better analogy for how a PM should think of their role than the coach of a team sport like basketball, volleyball, football, etc. Here’s why the parallels are so strong…

没有比团队运动（如篮球、排球、足球等）的教练更好的类比来说明产品经理应该如何看待自己的角色了。以下是为什么这些类比如此强烈...

### Coaches don’t play

教练不参与比赛

A coach doesn't play. They are hired to support a team, and do so by helping them increase their individual and collective potentials. They are measured - by the team and owners alike - by winning. Generally, if a team doesn't win, the coach is fired, not the players.

教练不参与比赛。他们被雇来支持一个团队，通过帮助团队成员提高个人和集体潜力来实现这一目标。他们的表现 — 无论是对团队还是对老板 — 都是通过胜利来衡量的。通常，如果一个团队不能获胜，被解雇的是教练，而不是球员。

A PM doesn't build, market, or support anything. We are hired to support a team in achieving our company's goals. We do this by enabling the team to maximize their individual and collective potentials by aligning everyone on a product strategy (principle A) and fostering a healthy team dynamic. Generally, if the team doesn't build something great, the product manager should be fired, not the team.

产品经理不构建、营销或支持任何东西。我们被雇来支持团队实现公司的目标。我们通过使团队在产品策略上保持一致（原则 A）并培养健康的团队动态，来使团队最大化他们的个人和集体潜力。通常，如果团队没有构建出伟大的东西，应该被解雇的是产品经理，而不是团队。

### A coach’s style is dependent on the relative skill of the coach and the players

教练的风格取决于教练和球员的相对技能水平
  
When I first wrote that PMs are like sports coaches, what did you visualize?

当我第一次写到产品经理就像体育教练时，你想象的是什么？

![Image 11](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*WQtvQ7N1x8eNajG7wRGz2Q.gif)

Do you see the coach as a parent and the team as kids? Or are the players like Lebron, telling the coach what to do? How about the wrist wrapping assistant coaches?

你是否将教练视为父母，将团队视为孩子？或者球员像勒布朗一样，告诉教练该做什么？那些包扎手腕的助理教练呢？

For example, if you're a PM straight out of college and you join a product team of seasoned engineers, why in the world would you play a leadership role? You shouldn't — you don't have the experience to back it up. But that doesn't mean you can't be useful.

例如，如果你是一个刚从大学毕业的产品经理，加入了一个由经验丰富的工程师组成的产品团队，你为什么要扮演领导角色呢？你不应该这样做 — 你没有足够的经验来支撑。但这并不意味着你不能发挥作用。

_PMs need strong self awareness to recognize when to lead, partner, or support their team._

产品经理需要强烈的自我意识来认识到何时应该领导、合作或支持他们的团队。

![Image 12](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*cFC-mHmXdjoOf1bQTMKbzw.png)

In the framework above, “skill” is shorthand for the sum of the abilities, experience, accomplishments, and work ethic of the people. Here’s how I’ve applied it in my career:

在上面的框架中，"技能"是人们的能力、经验、成就和职业道德总和的简称。以下是我在职业生涯中如何应用它的：

When I’m the PM on a team of fresh grads, I will take a very direct leadership approach. I will prescribe the frameworks, goals, and even how to organize the execution of the project. This makes sense, I’ve shipped projects and they haven’t.

当我是一个由应届毕业生组成的团队的产品经理时，我会采取非常直接的领导方式。我会规定框架、目标，甚至如何组织项目的执行。这是有道理的，因为我已经发布过项目，而他们还没有。

When I'm working with a team of equal skill to myself, I will default to collaboration on all key decisions, and aspire to get buy in from everybody on the strategy and execution. To be clear, a PM should aspire to collaborate in all cases, but this relative-skill dynamic warrants it the most.

当我与一个技能水平与我相当的团队合作时，我会在所有关键决策上默认采取合作方式，并努力在策略和执行上获得每个人的认同。需要明确的是，产品经理在所有情况下都应该追求合作，但这种相对技能的动态最需要这样做。

Finally, when I'm working with a team that's more experienced and accomplished than myself, I will revert to an assistant coach or trainer mindset. I will ask, how can I be helpful? What can I take off your plate that's low leverage? I'll play a pure support role. For example, I will start by asking the experienced team about their vision, and then follow it up with lots of questions to get down to _their_ first principles and strategy. Then, I'll synthesize all this information into a document and align with them to ensure it represents their vision. At that point, I'm just as free to align the company with this strategy as if I had developed it myself. I can still do my job.

最后，当我与一个比我更有经验和成就的团队合作时，我会回归到助理教练或培训师的心态。我会问，我怎样才能帮上忙？我可以为你分担哪些低效率的工作？我会扮演纯粹的支持角色。例如，我会先询问有经验的团队他们的愿景，然后跟进大量问题以了解他们的第一性原理和策略。然后，我会将所有这些信息综合成一份文档，并与他们保持一致，以确保它代表了他们的愿景。在那时，我就可以自由地让公司与这个策略保持一致，就像是我自己制定的一样。我仍然可以完成我的工作。

Note that in all cases, the PM is still responsible for the development of the product strategy, but how they get there can be very different.

请注意，在所有情况下，产品经理仍然负责制定产品策略，但他们达到这一目标的方式可能大不相同。

_Without a doubt, not understanding this dynamic of relative skill between the team and the PM, is the number one reason that PMs fail. They misread the situation, fall into the trap of thinking PM equals mini-CEO by default, and immediately lose trust with their team, which takes ten times as long to win back._

毫无疑问，不理解团队和产品经理之间相对技能的这种动态，是产品经理失败的首要原因。他们误读了情况，陷入了认为产品经理默认等同于迷你 CEO 的陷阱，并立即失去了团队的信任，而重新赢得信任需要十倍的时间。

### When the team wins, the players are celebrated, not the coach

当团队获胜时，庆祝的是球员，而不是教练

![Image 13](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*dxzYvKe-bV5DVQBsMWNrfQ.png)

People rarely talk about the coach when a team wins. The same should be true for product teams. If your team does incredible work, they deserve the spotlight — don’t steal it.

当一个团队获胜时，人们很少谈论教练。对于产品团队来说也应该如此。如果你的团队做出了令人难以置信的工作，他们应该得到关注 — 不要抢走它。

### Coaches need to know what every player does to be effective

教练需要了解每个球员的工作，才能有效发挥作用

![Image 14](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*QLY585b45bcMlMhislkXbw.png)

No one can coach a team if they don't even know how the game is played. You need to have empathy and respect for all the work individuals on your team undertake.

如果连游戏是如何进行的都不知道，就没有人能够指导一个团队。你需要对团队中每个人所做的工作都有同理心和尊重。

This is more useful than simply having a deeper understanding about what's easy versus hard to build. It's also about understanding what is _fun and intellectually stimulating_ work vs. mundane and repetitive work. No team is inspired doing the same type of work they've done before. That's when work becomes about a paycheque, and subsequently when the work itself is less creative and inspired.

这比仅仅深入理解什么容易构建和什么难以构建更有用。它还涉及理解什么是有趣和智力刺激的工作，相对于平凡和重复的工作。没有团队会因为做以前做过的同类工作而感到鼓舞。那时工作就变成了为了薪水，随之而来的是工作本身变得不那么有创意和灵感。

For a PM, respecting this encourages you to create the project conditions that enable people on the team to grow _and_ accomplish the mission for the company. When you create these conditions, the outcome is deep ownership and emotional investment from everyone.

对于产品经理来说，尊重这一点会鼓励你创造项目条件，使团队成员能够成长并为公司完成使命。当你创造这些条件时，结果就是每个人都有深度的所有权感和情感投入。

### When a captain emerges, coaches step back and let them lead

当队长出现时，教练会退后一步让他们领导

![Image 15](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3acocr-vI9l4uuW4qVPc7g.png)

It's clear that Lebron James is the captain. His team listens to him… maybe not Wade :)

很明显，勒布朗·詹姆斯是队长。他的团队听他的... 也许韦德除外 :)

As a team member, it's one thing to hear about how you're not executing from your coach, it's another thing entirely to hear it from someone putting in the same work as you. As a coach, when a player on your team emerges as a leader; someone who holds the rest accountable and challenges them to be better, you have the foundations for the highest performing type of team.

作为团队成员，从教练那里听到你没有执行到位是一回事，从和你一样工作的人那里听到这些则完全是另一回事。作为教练，当你的团队中有一个球员成为领导者时；有人能让其他人负责并挑战他们变得更好，你就拥有了最高绩效团队的基础。

In product teams, this person is typically an engineering or UX lead. When this happens, count your blessings and then work to further elevate their influence on the team. Make them a coach, too, and your co-founder.

在产品团队中，这个人通常是工程或用户体验的负责人。当这种情况发生时，要感恩，然后努力进一步提升他们在团队中的影响力。也让他们成为教练，成为你的联合创始人。

Typically, in this dynamic PMs will continue to lead strategy, while the captain drives execution, however PMs should also be open to "giving up" strategy as well, if it keeps the captain engaged and makes them feel true ownership. This is where you need to suppress your ego. It is so rare to find people who want to be leaders, so if the captain emerges, do whatever you can to capitalize on it (but hold them accountable, too).

通常在这种动态中，产品经理会继续领导策略，而队长负责执行，但是如果这能让队长保持参与并让他们感到真正的所有权，产品经理也应该开放地"放弃"策略。这就是你需要压制自己的自我的地方。想要成为领导者的人是如此罕见，所以如果队长出现了，你应该尽一切可能利用这个机会（但也要让他们负责）。

## Coaches ensure the team is training and in a peak state of performance

教练确保团队处于训练状态和最佳表现状态

Coaches don't spend all their time looking at video replays and strategizing with the team, they're also ensuring the team practices regularly so they can perform at their peak.

教练不会把所有时间都花在看录像回放和与团队制定策略上，他们还要确保团队定期练习，以便他们能够发挥最佳水平。

The parallel for product teams are product development processes. Whether you're hardcore agile/scrum, "process-less" (note: a process exists whether you choose to acknowledge it or not), or something in between — the coach is responsible for ensuring the team commits to a process that enables them to do their best work. Note that the optimal process will be different for each team and coach dynamic.

对于产品团队来说，与之相对应的是产品开发流程。无论你是严格的敏捷/Scrum，还是"无流程"（注意：无论你是否承认，流程都是存在的），或者是介于两者之间的某种方式 — 教练负责确保团队致力于一个能让他们做出最好工作的流程。请注意，最佳流程对每个团队和教练的动态都会有所不同。

### Coaches nurture the energy levels and mental state of the team

教练培养团队的能量水平和心理状态

This is an uncomfortable ownership concept for many PMs, but whenever I see a team that doesn’t seem excited about the work or looks burnt out, I’ll put pressure on the PM to foster a healthier dynamic.

这对许多产品经理来说是一个令人不舒服的所有权概念，但每当我看到一个团队似乎对工作不感兴趣或看起来精疲力尽时，我都会给产品经理施加压力，以培养一个更健康的动态。

This is difficult of course, because people are complicated. We are all motivated to do our best work by different things: some of us need encouragement, some need to be challenged, some need a friend, and some need all three at different times. PMs need to find a way to understand _what makes individuals on their team tick_ — the first principles of _their_ being — and then build meaning and purpose from work on top of those principles.

这当然很困难，因为人是复杂的。我们都被不同的事物激励去做最好的工作：有些人需要鼓励，有些人需要被挑战，有些人需要一个朋友，有些人在不同时候需要这三者。产品经理需要找到一种方法来理解是什么让他们团队中的个人产生动力 — 他们存在的第一性原理 — 然后在这些原理的基础上构建工作的意义和目的。

This concept can come off as self aggrandizing (_get out of my head PM!!!_), but it is the right one for a coach and PM to have. Creating an energized and committed team is fundamental to success, and achieving it repeatably is the pinnacle of good PM’ing and leadership in general.

这个概念可能看起来有点自我吹嘘（产品经理，别想控制我的思想！！！），但这对教练和产品经理来说是正确的。创造一个充满活力和承诺的团队是成功的基础，能够反复实现这一点是优秀产品管理和领导力的巅峰。

### The thing about first principles is that nothing else matters in the long run

关于第一性原理的事情是，从长远来看，其他什么都不重要

Exploring the first principles of Product Management reveal that it demands equal effort from the left and right brains. It’s equal parts art and science. It’s equal parts hyper-rational and hyper-emotional.

探索产品管理的第一性原理揭示了它需要左脑和右脑同等的努力。它既是艺术也是科学。它既是超理性的，也是超情感的。

It’s the polarity of these two ways of thinking that make the craft of product management complex, exciting, and frustrating all at once.

正是这两种思维方式的对立使得产品管理这门技艺变得复杂、令人兴奋，同时也令人沮丧。

Success for PMs means respecting both of these principles equally. Create a product strategy that maximizes impact to the mission, and have a coach’s mentality to accomplish that mission though the people around you.

对产品经理来说，成功意味着平等地尊重这两个原则。创造一个能最大化对使命影响的产品策略，并以教练的心态通过你周围的人来完成这个使命。
